 * and the DevEco CLI runner. Neither timeout exists upstream -- DevEco Code's own
 * `runBundledDevecoCli` is `Bun.spawn` plus `await proc.exited`, with no deadline and therefore no
 * cleanup problem. The timeouts are this pack's addition, so the cleanup is this pack's job.

/**
 * Terminate a spawned child and everything still running in its process group.
 *
 * The child must have been spawned with `detached: true`, which makes it a process-group leader;
 * signalling the negative pid then reaches its descendants too. Without that, a timed-out build
 * left the hvigor client front-end and ohpm downloads running.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT reach is the hvigor daemon. That is a persistent build server,
 * like Gradle's: it re-parents itself to pid 1 and becomes its own group leader, so it is already
 * outside any caller's group. Verified on a live machine -- the daemon showed PPID 1 and
 * PGID equal to its own pid, having survived several builds. Killing our group therefore cannot
 * disturb the daemon that DevEco Studio shares, which is the desired outcome, not a limitation.
 *
 * @param {import("node:child_process").ChildProcess} child The spawned child.
 * @param {number} [graceMs] How long to wait between SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
 * @returns {() => void} Cancels the pending escalation; called automatically once the child exits.

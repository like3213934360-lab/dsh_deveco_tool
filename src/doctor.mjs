/**
 * @file The environment report behind both `deveco-tool doctor` and the deveco_doctor MCP tool.
 * @author deveco-tool
 *
 * These two used to be assembled separately: the MCP tool reported Python, the ArkTS checker,
 * the DevEco CLI, the language server, HDC and login state, while the CLI reported only the
 * environment and the script registry -- even though PACK.md told people to run the CLI to check
 * exactly the things it did not check. Both now render this one report, so they cannot drift again.

/**
 * @file Fast device-UI tools that talk to hdc directly: capture, locate, observe, and input.
 * @author deveco-tool
 *
 * CodeGenie already proxies `perform_ui_action` and `get_app_ui_tree`, and both keep working
 * untouched. These exist beside them because the screenshot-driven loop (capture, find a control,
 * tap it) was paying for three avoidable things, all measured on a real device:
 *
 *   - `uitest screenCap` writes a full-resolution PNG: 1.05s end to end for 5.2MB. The same frame
 *     as JPEG through `snapshot_display` is 0.42s for ~260KB, with no visible loss for UI work.
 *   - Reading tap coordinates off that image is imprecise; a real estimate landed 40px off a tab
 *     centre. `uitest dumpLayout` carries an exact `$rect` per node.
 *   - Every action went through the CodeGenie child, whose handshake intermittently hangs forever
 *     (see src/codegenie-tools.mjs). Anything on that path inherits the stall.
 *
 * Everything here runs over hdc in this process, so the loop keeps working when the child is gone.
 *
 * Three later decisions came out of measuring the loop itself rather than the individual calls:
 *
 *   - `uitest` is a device singleton but `snapshot_display` is not, so only uitest work takes the
 *     lock. The two were confirmed to overlap on a real device (356ms of genuine concurrency).
 *   - `ui_observe` runs both in one shell round trip with the capture backgrounded. Fusing alone
 *     bought nothing -- 1736ms against 1731ms, because a `file recv` is only ~48ms and `dumpLayout`
 *     is the 1.25s long pole -- but fusing *and* overlapping them lands at 1238ms.
 *   - Captures are bounded by the longest edge a vision consumer will keep rather than by a chosen
 *     width, because that is the point past which extra pixels are resized away and charged for
 *     anyway. Cost follows pixel area alone -- not bytes, not encoding -- so resolution is the only
 *     lever there is, and it is the one that was set wrong: a fixed 480px default made small text
 *     unreadable on a dense display. See MAX_CAPTURE_LONG_EDGE.

 * The longest edge worth capturing, because it is the longest edge the consumer will keep.

 * the larger capture buys is bytes on the wire. Below it, resolution is the only thing that helps:
 * cost follows pixel *area*, never file size or encoding, so no choice of format saves anything.
 *
 * This replaced a fixed 480px default, which was wrong twice over. It was picked from one reading
 * of one screen, and it was expressed as an absolute width when what decides legibility is the
 * scale factor -- 480px is 38% of a 1276px display and 30% of a 1600px one, so the same number
 * quietly degrades as displays get denser, and the failure surfaces as the model misreading the
 * screen rather than as a setting being wrong. Measured against a lossless capture of the same
 * screen, JPEG loss also got *worse* as resolution dropped (34.0dB at 480px against 37.7dB at
 * 1154px): scaling down and compression damage the same text edges, and compound.
 *
 * Capping the long edge instead is self-adjusting. A denser display is scaled further, a smaller
 * one is not scaled at all, and a consumer with a lower ceiling of its own simply resizes again
 * and is charged its own lower price. `width` still overrides it downward for a long loop where
